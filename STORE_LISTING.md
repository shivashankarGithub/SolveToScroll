**Take back control of your screen time with SolveToScroll.**

Mindlessly scrolling through social media again? SolveToScroll helps you break the cycle by adding a small mental challenge before accessing your most distracting apps.

### How It Works

1. **Choose apps to block** - Select which apps distract you most (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, etc.)
2. **Set your schedule** - Block during work hours, bedtime, or custom times
3. **Complete a challenge** - When you try to open a blocked app, solve a quick puzzle first
4. **Earn access** - Successfully complete the challenge for 5 minutes of guilt-free scrolling
5. **Build awareness** - The pause helps you realize: "Do I really need this right now?"

### Three Types of Challenges

**Math Problems** - Quick arithmetic to engage your logical brain
**Typing Tests** - Enter motivational phrases to reinforce positive thinking  
**Reflection Prompts** - Brief writing exercises that build mindfulness

### Smart Difficulty Adjustment

- Challenges start easy and increase difficulty if you keep trying
- After multiple attempts, a wait timer encourages you to step away
- This isn't about punishment—it's about building awareness
